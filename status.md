Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Bot can now detect user joining/leaving, plays an audio clip when it joins a call.

Bot can resume, pause, and stop audio.

Bot can detect specific words and act upon those key words.

Bot can use embeds.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

All basic functions are implemented. Now working on making bigger functions with the knowledge I have gained.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I encountered an issue with the audio portion involving getting the track to play. This was fixed after resetting the software.

A large problem I encountered was accidentally pushing a commit that had my discord activation key in it, which prompted github to stop any pushes to the server. The fix for this took too much time, so I resorted to making a new repository with the code moved over.
