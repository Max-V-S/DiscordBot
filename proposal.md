# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Overall Useful Discord Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This bot will be able to play music, give roles, or type in a discord server, given a command.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This discord bot should be able to recieve multiple types of commands, and be able to provide a variety of text or information with said command. The bot should be able to understand what song is being asked to be played, and then join a channel to play it. It should also be able to see the current rolls in the server, and be able to give players a role based on if a button is pressed or the user reacts with a certain emoji. It should also be able to provide information about a user based off the command given, such as how long the user has been in the server for. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome of this project would involve the bot being able to do at least one of the previously mentioned actions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be that the bot can do every action previously listed, that being music playing, role setting, and text responses of user info.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be that I finish the functions in the BETTER steps early, allowing me to add even more small but fun features such as dice rolls or lotteries that select a random user that signs up for the event.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps for this project will be learning how to actually link a bot with discord, and how I can access resources from discord to give to the bot. I will need to learn all of the commands to do so, as well as figure out how to implement my current knowledge of python to make use of the information and resources. I will also need to learn how to automate these tasks to have them constantly running. While this isn't neccessarily a new skill, I will also need to get used to working with much larger chunks of code, and figure out how to implement them to work well with each other.
